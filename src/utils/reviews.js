    description: 'Great experience with Flex Moving!!! Mike and his team were quick, efficient, respectful and kind. They took the time to wrap more fragile items including a heavy marble pieces. They also did a great job at organizing everything into the storage unit and they were very patient trying to fit all my stuff into the unit! Will definitely be using their service again when I plan to move things out of the storage.',
