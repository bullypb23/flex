    description: 'Great experience with Flex Moving!!! Mike and his team were quick, efficient, respectful and kind. They took the time to wrap more fragile items including a heavy marble pieces. They also did a great job at organizing everything into the storage unit and they were very patient trying to fit all my stuff into the unit! Will definitely be using their service again when I plan to move things out of the storage.',

    description: 'Amazing moving company with excellent service and superb drivers.  We moved long distance (about 600 miles and 11 hour drive) and we could not have done it without Flex Moving!  Not only they gave us the best price (out of five moving companies we considered), but they also provided the best moving option (which other moving companies did not even offer.) All our furniture, boxes, and other stuff arrived in great condition  and intact.  There were no additional charges or hidden fees or any other issues.  I highly recommend Flex Moving!',

    description: 'We hired Flex to move from Manhattan to Jersey City and it was the best move I’ve had (and this was my 5th move in NYC). The 3 movers were nice, fast, polite and didn’t waste any time. I’ve had movers come with 3 people, but 2 watch the truck… this time, all 3 were moving items to speed up the process. I would be happy to use them again.',
